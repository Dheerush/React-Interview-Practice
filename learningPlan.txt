============================================================
PHASE 1: TOOLING & FRONTEND BASICS (VERY HIGH PRIORITY)
============================================================

CORE CONCEPTS:
1. npm / yarn / pnpm
   - package.json (dependencies vs devDependencies)
   - node_modules resolution
   - npm scripts
   - lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock)

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Difference between dependencies and devDependencies?
- What happens when you run npm install?
- Why lock files are important?
- npm vs yarn vs pnpm?

2. Vite / CRA / Webpack
- Vite: dev = esbuild, prod = rollup
- CRA: webpack-based, slower, legacy
- Webpack: configurable but heavy

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Why Vite is faster?
- How bundling works?
- Dev vs production build difference?

3. Babel
- Transpiles modern JS → browser-compatible JS
- JSX → JS
- Does NOT bundle

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Why do we need Babel if browsers support ES6?
- Babel vs TypeScript?

============================================================
PHASE 2: CORE JAVASCRIPT (MUST-HAVE)
============================================================

TOPICS:
1. Closures
- What is a closure?
- Where closures are used in React?
- How closures cause memory leaks (event listeners, timers)

2. Debouncing vs Throttling
- Debounce: execute after delay (search input)
- Throttle: execute at intervals (scroll, resize)

CODING:
- Implement debounce(fn, delay)
- Implement throttle(fn, delay)

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Difference between debounce and throttle?
- Where would you use each?

3. Event Loop
- Call stack
- Microtasks vs macrotasks
- setTimeout vs Promise

============================================================
PHASE 3: REACT CORE (MOST IMPORTANT)
============================================================

HOOKS (YOU MUST CODE):
- useState
- useEffect (cleanup, dependency array)
- useRef
- useMemo
- useCallback
- React.memo

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Why useEffect runs twice in StrictMode?
- Difference between useMemo and useCallback?
- When NOT to use useCallback?
- What causes unnecessary re-renders?

CUSTOM HOOKS (PRACTICE):
- useDebounce
- useThrottle
- useFetch
- usePrevious

INTERVIEW CODING:
- Build a search with debounce
- API call with loading & error states
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components

============================================================
PHASE 4: DATA HANDLING, STATE & ARCHITECTURE
============================================================

API HANDLING:
- fetch vs axios
- loading, error, success states
- pagination
- infinite scroll
- retry logic

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- How do you handle API failures?
- How do you avoid race conditions?
- What is optimistic UI?

CONTEXT API:
- When to use context
- When NOT to use context
- Performance pitfalls

REDUX / REDUX TOOLKIT:
- store, slice, reducer
- thunk for async actions
- loading & error handling

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Context vs Redux?
- Why Redux Toolkit?
- What problem does thunk solve?

============================================================
PHASE 5: PERFORMANCE, TESTING & ADVANCED TOPICS
============================================================

PERFORMANCE:
- React.memo
- useCallback
- useMemo
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Virtualization
- Web Workers (off-main-thread work)

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- How do you improve page performance?
- How to debug re-renders?
- When memoization is harmful?

TESTING (RTL + JEST – VERY IMPORTANT):
- Jest basics
- React Testing Library philosophy
- fireEvent vs userEvent
- getBy / queryBy / findBy
- Mocking APIs
- Snapshot testing (when NOT to use)

INTERVIEW PRACTICE QUESTIONS:
- Write a test for a button click
- Test API loading state
- Mock fetch / axios
- Test conditional rendering

============================================================
FINAL 24-HOUR STRATEGY
============================================================

DAY BEFORE INTERVIEW:
- Revise hooks & JS basics
- Practice 2–3 coding questions
- Review debounce/throttle
- Review useEffect edge cases

INTERVIEW DAY:
- Think aloud
- Write clean code
- Explain trade-offs
- Don’t over-optimize prematurely

============================================================
GOLDEN INTERVIEW LINE (USE THIS):
============================================================

"I focus on predictable state, clean side-effects, and performance-aware React patterns rather than premature optimization."
