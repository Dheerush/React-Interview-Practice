/** ==================== Set 1: Foundation Practice  ==========================
 * Q1. Closures.
 *     1. What are closures. Give me a basic example. Explain how closure works
 *     1. What is a closure? Write the simplest example.
 *     2. Show how a closure retains variables after function execution.
 *     3. Create a function that counts how many times a button is clicked.
 *     4. Create a React component where a closure is used.
 *     5. Explain how closures can cause memory leaks and how to prevent them.
 * 
 * 
 * Q2. Event Loop:
 *     1. Explain the event loop using console.log.
 *     2. Write code mixing: setTimeout, Promise, synchronous code and explain output order.
 *     3. What are: Call Stack, Microtask Queue, Macrotask Queue?
 *     4. Show event loop behavior inside a React component.
 *     5. What happens if the call stack is blocked?
 *     
 * 
 * Q3. Timers (setTimeout / setInterval)
 *     1. Create a timer that starts automatically.
 *     2. Create a timer with start / pause / reset.
 *     3. Difference between setTimeout and setInterval.
 *     4. What happens if you forget to clear a timer?
 *     5. How do you clean timers in React?
 *     
 * 
 * Q4. Debounce & Throttle 
 *     1. Implement debounce for a search input.
 *     2. Explain why debounce is needed.
 *     3. Implement throttle for scroll events.
 *     4. Difference between debounce and throttle.
 *     5. Real-world use cases (search, resize, scroll).
 *     
 * 
 * Q5. this, scope, arrow functions: 
 *     1. What is this? Show 3 different behaviors.
 *     2. Difference between arrow function and normal function.
 *     3. this inside: object, function and arrow
 *     4. bind, call, apply example.
 *     5. Common this bugs in React.
 * 
 * 
 * Q6. 
 *    1. What is IIFE
 *    2. What is try-catch
 *    3. What is promise, 
 *    4. diffeenrece between rest and spread 
 *    5. 
 * 
 * 
 * Q7. Call Stack (VERY IMPORTANT – ties JS, Event Loop, React bugs)
 *     1. What is the Call Stack? Explain it using a simple function call example.
 *     2. Write nested function calls and explain how they enter and exit the Call Stack.
 *     3. What is stack overflow? Write an example that causes it.
 *     4. How does the Call Stack interact with the Event Loop?
 *     5. How can blocking the Call Stack affect UI rendering in a browser / React app?
 *
 *
 * Q8. Memory Management & Garbage Collection (FOUNDATIONAL BUT IMPRESSIVE)
 *     1. How does JavaScript allocate memory for variables and functions?
 *     2. What is Garbage Collection? Explain it in simple terms.
 *     3. What are memory leaks? Give JavaScript examples.
 *     4. How can closures cause memory leaks?
 *     5. How do you prevent memory leaks in React applications?
